# Draw
A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation


Most of the generative models learns to generate whole image in one step like Variational AutoEncoders, Generative Adversarial Networks etc. In mathematical terms all the pixels in the images are generated by conditioning on latent distribution. The Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer(DRAW) takes a  deviation from typical form of generation of images.

When a person is asked to draw or paint a picture, he/she will follow some sequential procedure like rough sketch, sharpening rough sketch by altering or erasing and shading  for getting the entire image. In every step a refinement in the image takes place and finally a well finished image delivers as an output. DRAW network inspires from above sequential process to generate images. DRAW uses the attention mechanism to generate images step by step.
